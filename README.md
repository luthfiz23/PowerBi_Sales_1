# PowerBi_Sales_1
Practicing data visualisation with Power BI. It was fun and relatively simple to do!ðŸ’ƒ
## Objective
1. Analyzing how the sales quantity and profit moves throughout the year.
2. Determining which product category (or sub-category) is ordered the most, which one is the most profitable, and which one is making the shop lose money.
3. See how customers from different cities buy products from the shop.

## Insights
1. There are 500 orders from customers through 2018, with over 5.5K products sold worth at least 438K INR.
2. However, from the 438K INR gross income, the profit of the shop is only totaling around 37K INR. Which is just a little over 8%.
3. The most profitable quarter was the 1st Q with 173 orders and profit of 26K INR.
4. The most non-profitable quarter was the 3rd Q with 92 orders and the shop was losing 1400+ INR.
5. Overall, the shop was gaining profit from January - April, but the sales started to decline and causes the shop to lose money in May. The sales and profit started to grow slowly again in August until its last peak in November.
